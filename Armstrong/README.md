### Description
An Armstrong number is the one that equals the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits in that number which is to be checked. To be more clear, let the number be n and the number of digits be x. We represent the number as nx nx-1 nx-2...n3 n2 n1 where n1, n2, n3...nx are single digits 0-9. n is an Armstrong number if

n1x + n2x + n3x + nx-1x + nxx = n
